 
Programming competition – prize $1000!

Primal Space Systems, Inc. is looking for skilled programmers, and we’re giving out cold hard cash for doing the type of coding we do. Think of it as a chance of getting paid for a job interview.



Requirements:

Purely C++ - no java, C#, Python, Perl, Haskell, Lisp, Pascal, Fortran, Assembly – just C++ 11 with STL please.

Given a 3D model defined as an array of v vertices (defined via 3 floats x, y, z) and an array of t triangles (defined via 3 indices into the array of vertices). We will supply 3 models to experiment with in a custom JSON and Wavefront obj format.
Use of Visual Studio 2015 is recommended; it can be downloaded for free from the link below

•	https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx

Extract and implement the Hugues Hoppe progressive mesh functionality using the types defined in the supplied header file CommonTypes.h (Some will recognize these types as being a subset of the types used in the Unreal Engine). Fully functional code to do this and many, many other things is available in the link below.

•	Paper: http://hhoppe.com/pm.pdf

•	Source code: https://rawgit.com/Microsoft/Mesh-processing-library/master/README.html

Add in the Gortler tweak from the following paper to ensure the progressive mesh remains inside the original mesh for all splits. It’s in the “Section 3 – Progressive Hull – Interior volume” section.

•	http://cs.harvard.edu/~sjg/papers/silclip.pdf

Save the results in a JSON file.

We have added a stub project to GitHub for you to get a head start.

•	https://github.com/primal-space-systems/ProgressiveMeshChallenge

Submissions should be sent via email to info@primalspacesystems.com with a link to a download site.

The deadline for submission is midnight EDT on September 30th 2016.



How the winner will be chosen:

•	The code generates a progressive mesh that is always inside the original mesh (i.e., the code works).

•	The code uses all the correct types, good variable naming, and is easy to follow (i.e., the best written code).

•	The code finds a good balance between ease of use and configurability.



The small print:

•	Multiple participants could be invited to a follow up interview, but a job offer is not guaranteed and will be contingent upon further assessment of the candidate.

•	The winning submission belongs to Primal Space Systems, Inc.

•	The winner is decided purely at the discretion of the programmers at Primal Space.
